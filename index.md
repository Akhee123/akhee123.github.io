My name is Muhammad Aburmeeleh, and I am an ambitous electrical engineer, electronic design enthusiast and maker. I have always been curious about and insterested in how the technology around us is made and how the software and hardware of our daily life products are functioning and connected.

Over the past years as an engineer, I have worked in the field of CNC and material machining. I also do freelancing work in electronic design and helped many people and engineering graduates execute their ideas and projects.

I started building a personal electronics lab when I was a second year student at university, and ever since then, I have expanded on it and been using it to do my freelance work. Electronic Design is a passion of mine and I spend most of my time learning and expermenting on new topics related to it.

I hold a diploma in Enghlish Language from the American Embassy in Jerusalem and acquired my BSc. in Electrical Engineering from Al Quds University.
