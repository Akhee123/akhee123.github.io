I started building my home lab when I was in my second year at the university. The reason behind it was my curiosity and interest in electronics. Ever since then, I have been using it to tinker, learn new subjects about electronics and build projects. This lab kickstarted my freelancing journey in electronics and helped me through the years in engineering school.

## Equipment
### Power Supply
The most essential tool in any lab, and always remember, you can never have enough power supplies. I started with a simple computer power supply and moved on to **NPS-1601** adjustable power supply.

### Function Generator
This piece of equipment is not essential but good to have. I bought an FY6900-60M function generator. It offers multiple stored functions, arbitrary waveforms and has a software that extends its waveform control.

### Oscilloscope 
A crucial tool for analog electronics and signal analysis. I got Hantek **iDSO1070A**. It's a compact PC based oscilscope. It has WiFi and USB connectivity and its software covers a wide range of functions; such as FTT, Frequency analysis, various voltage measurements.

## Evaluation Boards
### Microcontrollers
I got a variety of microcontrollers throughout the years and each of them was for a purpose. Arduino boards for quick prototyping and ease of use. STM32 fast and complex applications. ESP32 for IoT connectivity and simplicity. Raspberry Pi Pico for small applications that require more computing power.

### SBCs 
Tiny powerful computers for large applications. I have Raspberry Pis for applications that require a lot of computing power, IoT connectivity and fast GPIO operations. I also have an Orange Pi to dabble more in the world of open source SBC. And the last piece I have is a DE0 Nano SOC, which is basically an FPGA and an SBC on the same board and it's used for applications that require huge computing power and a lot of custom digital circuitry in the system.

## Electronic Tools and Components
### Sensors
I collected a huge variety of sensors through the years for many purposes. Some of them are gas detection, proximity, accelerometer, humidity and many many other sensors.

### Soldering
The T12-952 soldering station is a cheap and convenient tool that supports T12 soldering tips that are suited for every purpose.

### Generic Components
Those components are present in every electronics lab and important to always have. I have multiple components that include; transistors, LEDs, resistors, capacitors, jumper wires, perf boards, digital and analog ICs, MOSFETs, multimeters and screwdriver set.
