I started building my home lab when I was in my second year at the university. The reason behind it was my curiosity and interest in electronics. Ever since then, I have been using it to tinker, learn new subjects about electronics and build projects; either for fun or to help others. This lab kickstarted my freelancing journey in electronics and helped me through the years in engineering school.

Here are the equiment and components that I have collected through the years.

## Equipment
### Power Supply
### Function Generator
### Oscilloscope
