I started building my home lab when I was in my second year at the university. The reason behind it was my curiosity and interest in electronics. Ever since then, I have been using it to tinker, learn new subjects about electronics and build projects; either for fun or to help others. This lab kickstarted my freelancing journey in electronics and helped me through the years in engineering school.

Most of the equipment I have is made for hobbyists or is part of an open source project. Hence, I am an open source enthusiast. So, here are the equiment and components that I have collected through the years.

## Equipment
### Power Supply
The most essential tool in any lab, and always remember, you can never have enough power supplies. I started with a simple computer power supply and moved on to **NPS-1601** adjustable power supply.

### Function Generator
This piece of equipment is not essential but good to have. I bought an FY6900-60M function generator. It offers multiple stored functions, arbitrary waveforms and has a software that extends its waveform control.

### Oscilloscope 
A crucial tool for analog electronics and signal analysis. I got Hantek **iDSO1070A**. It's a compact PC based oscilscope. It has WiFi and USB connectivity and its software covers a wide range of functions; such as FTT, Frequency analysis, various voltage measurements.

## Evaluation Boards
### Microcontrollers
I got a variety of microcontrollers throughout the years and each of them was for a purpose. Arduino boards for quick prototyping and ease of use. STM32 fast and complex applications. ESP32 for IoT connectivity and simplicity. 
### SBCs
