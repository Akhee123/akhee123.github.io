I started building my home lab when I was in my second year at the university. The reason behind it was my curiosity and interest in electronics. Ever since then, I have been using it to tinker, learn new subjects about electronics and build projects; either for fun or to help others. This lab kickstarted my freelancing journey in electronics and helped me through the years in engineering school.

Most of the equipment I have is made for hobbyists or is part of an open source project. Hence, I am an open source enthusiast. So, here are the equiment and components that I have collected through the years.

## Equipment
### Power Supply
The most essential tool in any lab, and always remember, you can never have enough power supplies. I started with a simple computer power supply and moved on to NPS-1601 adjustable power supply.

### Function Generator
This piece of equipment is not essential but good to have. I mostly used to build my own circuits for simple waves but later on needed a more advanced function generator to help me get the job done quickly. In the end, I bought an FY6900-60M arbitrary function generator.
